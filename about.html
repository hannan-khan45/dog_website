    <h2>Welcome to Crescent Convent School</h2>

        decided to equip the children will pragmatic skills so that they can face the future with renewed confidence and
        matchless courage. The management of school is always nurturing the institute keeping in sight and providing all
        the facilities, as and when required, with the help of management committee.</p>
